/*
n prisoners are standing on a circle, sequentially numbered from 0 to nâˆ’1.
An executioner walks along the circle, starting from prisoner 0, removing every
k-th prisoner and killing him. As the process goes on, the circle becomes
smaller and smaller, until only one prisoner remains, who is then freed. For
example, if there are n=5 prisoners and k=2, the order the prisoners are killed
in (let's call it the "killing sequence") will be 1, 3, 0, and 4, and the
survivor will be #2.
